# Friday-Basic-AI
Hey there, This program is one of the basic level AI voice assistants. Her name is Friday (extracted from the IronMan series!). It could perform a couple of tasks such as opening a browser, searching Wikipedia, opening applications on your device, greeting you, telling the time, and even jokes.  Although it was built as a basic AI Voice assistant, we could take this to the next level by adding as many tasks as you want. It takes much time patience to move it to an advanced program. You should also think about the space complexity and the time complexity especially you are doing it commercially.
